#### We have been serving _very_ heavy loads without any donations to keep the service free. Therefore, the site has moved to a 'freemium' model while maintaining a very low cost for even higher resolution (30 meters) and will continue to offer free elevations for 1km resolution.

Public interface for [https://elevation-api.io](https://elevation-api.io), relating to any issues found or comments for new features.
